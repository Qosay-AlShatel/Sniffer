# Problem Statement
A lost dog or cat scenario is every pet owner's worst nightmare. When a beloved pet 
strays from its home, it can be a traumatic experience for both the pet and its owner. 
Sniffer is a mobile application that connects to an Arduino device with a GPS 
module, which can be attached to a pet's collar. This will allow pet owners to set virtual fences 
and receive notifications when their pet exits the designated boundary. Additionally, the pet 
owner can track the pet's location in real-time, providing peace of mind and a sense of security. 
The proposed solution aims to alleviate the stress and uncertainty of pet ownership by providing 
a reliable and convenient way to monitor a pet's location and ensure their safety
